        <div>As a Lawyer I spent years studying and training in the legal world. Throughout my career, I have developed skills in research, analysis and problem solving, which have enabled me to tackle complex challenges. <br />

However, all my life I had a great affinity with computers. Curiosity led me to take the CS50x course as an introductory course to web programming, and it was a one-way trip, I fell in love with code. That's why I decided to change course and embark on a new adventure as a Full Stack web developer. <br />

Through my training and experience in law, I have developed skills that help me excel as a developer. For example, my ability to analyze and synthesize complex information allows me to quickly understand new technologies and apply them effectively in development projects. <br />

As a developer throughout the Plataforma 5 Bootcamp, I worked on several exciting projects (such as the internship for Globant) where I was able to collaborate with the team to create unique and high-quality applications. The exercise of the SCRUM methodology was fundamental throughout the development of the projects, turning out to be an invaluable experience. <br />

I am excited and motivated about this new career in technology and am looking forward to continuing to learn and grow as a web developer. I am always open to new opportunities and look forward to working on innovative and challenging projects in the future ðŸ’«</div>
